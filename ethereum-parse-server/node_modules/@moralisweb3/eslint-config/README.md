# @moralisweb3/eslint-config

Eslint rules, used by Moralis. These rules are based on community standards (and inspired by the airbnb and google presets), without taking too much opinionated/formatting rules into account.

# Usage
```js
{
  "extends": "@moralisweb3",
  "rules": {
    // Additional, per-project rules...
  }
}
```
